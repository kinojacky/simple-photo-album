- Support for various image aspect ratios
- Download functionality for individual photos
- Multi-language support (5 languages)

## Technologies Used

## Languages Supported

This photo album supports 5 languages:

1. English (en)
2. Traditional Chinese (zh-tw)
3. Simplified Chinese (zh-cn)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser
- A local web server (e.g., Python's `http.server` or Node.js' `http-server`)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/simple-photo-album.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd simple-photo-album
```

3. Start a local web server. For example, with Python:

```
python -m http.server 8000
```

4. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

- Click on any thumbnail to open the lightbox view
- Use arrow keys to navigate between photos in the lightbox
- Press 'D' to download the current photo
- Press 'ESC' to close the lightbox
- Use the pagination controls at the bottom of the page to navigate through the photo collection
- Use the language dropdown to switch between supported languages

## Customization

To add your own photos, modify the `photoData.json` file in the project root directory. Each photo object should include:

- `thumbnail`: URL of the thumbnail image
- `original`: URL of the full-size image
- `filename` (optional): Name of the file (used for download and display in the lightbox)

Example of a photo object in `photoData.json`:

```json
{
  "thumbnail": "path/to/thumbnail.jpg",
  "original": "path/to/original.jpg",
  "filename": "Beautiful Sunset.jpg"
}
```

If you don't want to include a filename for a photo, you can either omit the filename field or leave it as an empty string:

```json
{
  "thumbnail": "path/to/thumbnail.jpg",
  "original": "path/to/original.jpg",
  "filename": ""
}
```

or

```json
{
  "thumbnail": "path/to/thumbnail.jpg",
  "original": "path/to/original.jpg"
}
```

## Configuration

The photo album includes a configurable download option. To enable or disable downloads:

1. Open the `script.js` file.
2. Locate the `enableDownload` variable at the top of the file.
3. Set it to `true` to enable downloads, or `false` to disable them:

```javascript
const enableDownload = true; // or false
```

When downloads are disabled:

- The download button will be hidden in the lightbox
- The 'D' key shortcut will not trigger a download
- The usage instructions on the top will not mention the download functionality

If you need to toggle this setting dynamically, you can use the `toggleDownloadFunctionality(enable)` function in your JavaScript code. For example:

- To enable downloads: `toggleDownloadFunctionality(true)`
- To disable downloads: `toggleDownloadFunctionality(false)`

You can run these commands in the browser's console to toggle the download functionality on the fly.
